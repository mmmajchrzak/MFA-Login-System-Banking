# Safe-Login-System-Banking
Two-factor authentication for banking systems which agreed to create and provide dedicated clients' mailboxes with unique aliases.
Works ofc on Android devices with biometric (fingerprint) scanner. Decided to get rid of Face recognition auth due to it's:
- slow pace of action
- unreliability
- lack of high end security (comparing with Cupertino's Face ID)
