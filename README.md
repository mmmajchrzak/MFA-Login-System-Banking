# Safe-Login-System-Banking
Multi-factor authentication app for banking systems which permit to create and provide dedicated clients' mailboxes with unique aliases and sufixes.
Works ofc on Android devices with biometric (fingerprint) scanner. Decided to get rid of Face recognition auth due to it's:
- slow pace of action
- unreliability
- lack of high end security (comparing with Face ID)
